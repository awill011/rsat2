Migration,"<b>NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the entry “Migration” from Wallace Wimpole's Bird Book (© 1998 by Wallace Wimpole).</b>
<br>It has been well known among even casual observers of the natural world that many bird species make seasonal trips between cooler breeding grounds in the spring and summer, and warmer locations in the autumn and winter. Migration is a part of the annual cycle of over 50 billion individual birds worldwide. (This is not to say all birds migrate; there are many species, particularly in the tropics, that maintain a single residence year-round.) However, the biological mechanisms that prompt birds to choose a particular date to begin migration are complex and seem to be influenced by many factors. 
<br><br>
<br>The most obvious pressure on the timing of seasonal bird migration is the weather. As the weather cools and precipitation increases, birds living in temperate climates move in the direction of warmer weather. However, seasonal weather patterns are notoriously unpredictable. Cloud cover can obscure even reliable measures of the seasons, such as the position of the sun and the stars. Therefore, it is clear that birds must rely more heavily on an internal clock to time their seasonal movements. In fact, biologists have observed a phenomenon known as “migratory restlessness” in caged birds at the same time the wild members of their species set off on seasonal migrations. 
<br><br>
<br>For most migratory birds, food supply is a major factor that contributes to the need to move from one location to another. Birds must have ample nutrition to reproduce, and seasonal changes in weather affect the availability of berries, nuts, insects, rodents, and other sources of nourishment. Furthermore, birds must store a great deal of energy in the form of body fat to fuel their migration, so they have to leave while their reserves are high, before changes in weather cause the food supply to dwindle. Many species seem to anticipate changes in weather and food sources, and adjust their migration schedules to accommodate significant variations in weather and food supply that occur from year to year, causing scientists to speculate that unknown internal stimuli may have a strong effect on the timing of the migration decision. 
<br><br>
<br>In 1967, Russian ornithologists Viktor Dolnik and Tatiana Blyumental collected chaffinches as they migrated along the Baltic Coast. By examining the fat content and food in the gut of the carcasses of birds gathered at different stages of the waves of migration, and then comparing these findings to the number of birds out of the total population yet to migrate, the scientists determined the social influence fat, healthy birds have on the remaining population that was not as physically fit for migration. Dolnik and Blyumental found that on the first day of each wave of migration, only very fat birds flew. These birds left at sunrise, on days when weather conditions were favorable. They did not feed before beginning their migratory flight, instead relying on stored fat for energy. 
<br><br>
<br>On the second day, the chaffinch migration began again in the morning with fat birds. By the afternoon the migration volume peaked, as more and more lean birds began to migrate, many with the morning’s food still in their stomachs. By the third day, almost all the birds that began to migrate were very lean. These birds began their migration only after feeding in the morning. Often these leaner birds began their migration despite inclement weather. Dolnik and Blyumental suggested that the social pressure exerted by the large volume of healthier birds in the flock that had already begun to migrate was an influence strong enough to override the lean birds’ poor physical readiness and the adverse conditions as factors in their decision to migrate. The scientists conducted their experiment on only one species, and though chaffinches are typical of diurnal migratory land birds, they do not accurately represent sea birds, raptors, or nocturnal species. Nonetheless, Dolnik and Blyumental’s work suggests that social pressure could explain why many different species of birds choose to migrate at apparently unfavorable times. 
<br><br>
<br>Some migratory birds travel much further than chaffinches. Most migrants spend a great deal of time storing energy to make trips that take a matter of days or weeks to complete, and travel tens to hundreds of kilometers, spending most of their lives in residence at their breeding grounds and their winter habitats. A few species, however, can spend months of each year en route between residences continents apart, and expend little more energy flying than sitting still. Wandering albatrosses spend almost all their time in the air, either migrating or foraging over oceans, moving up to 2000 kilometers on a single foraging expedition, and flying over 250,000 kilometers in a year (a distance equivalent to 4.6 times around the earth’s equator.) Such sea birds rely on their specialized wing structure to hold them aloft in air currents that transport them long distances, and some travel back and forth along the same paths on schedules dictated by the prevailing winds.

Depression,"<b>SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from T. H. Watkins’ The Great Depression (©1993, Little, Brown and Co.; Blackside Inc.). </b>
<br><br>
<br>One of the most durable and well-regarded of all the New Deal’s programs came from President Roosevelt himself, who had his own share of inventiveness. If the president cared about the fate of people, he also cared about the fate of trees, having practiced the art of silviculture on his Hyde Park estate with such enthusiasm that on various official forms he was fond of listing his occupation as “tree farmer.” It was in early March 1933 that he proceeded to bring the two concerns together—enlisting young unemployed men in a kind of volunteer “army” to be put to work in the national forests, national parks, and on other federal public lands. When he went to Congress for authorization of the program, he called the new agency the Civilian Corps Reforestation Youth Rehabilitation Movement, but before sinking under the weight of an acronym like CCRYRM, it was soon changed to the Civilian Conservation Corps (known forever after as the CCC). 
<br><br>
<br>Congress chose not to handle the details itself. It simply authorized the president to create the program and structure it as he saw fit by executive order; it was to last two years. Responsibility was divided up among the Labor Department, which was to screen and select the enrollees, the War Department, which would house and feed them in their nonworking hours, and the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, which would design and supervise projects in regional and national forests, national parks, and other public lands. The men would be paid $30 a month, anywhere from $23 to $25 of it to be sent to their families. 
<br><br>
<br>The CCC officially began on April 5, 1933, calling for an enrollment of 250,000 to be housed in 1,468 camps around the country. The cost for the first year was estimated at $500 million. The men had to be U.S. citizens between the ages of seventeen and twenty-seven (later, twenty-four), out of school, out of work, capable of physical labor, over 60 inches but under 78 inches in height, more than 107 pounds in weight, and had to possess no fewer than “three serviceable natural masticating teeth above and below.” They would serve terms of no more than nine months so that as many as possible could be accommodated over the course of time. 
<br><br>
<br>Among the earliest enrollees were some veterans who had returned to Washington, setting up camp and demanding payment of their bonuses for service during the war. While making it clear that he opposed the payments on economic grounds, FDR provided tents, showers, mess halls, and latrines, and, waiving the age restriction for them, invited the members of this new Bonus Army to join his new agency. What was more, Eleanor Roosevelt dropped by one rainy day for a visit, slogging through ankle-deep mud to meet and talk with the men. “Hoover sent the army,” said one veteran of the previous summer’s BEF disaster, “Roosevelt sent his wife.” When it became clear that no bonus would be forthcoming, about twenty-five hundred of the men took Roosevelt up on his offer and joined the CCC. 
<br><br>
<br>In the summer of 1934, Roosevelt expanded the size of the CCC to 350,000 and would raise it to 500,000 in 1935. Congress continued to reauthorize it faithfully over the next seven years, and by the time it was closed out in 1942, the CCC had put more than three million young “soil soldiers” to work. In the national forests alone they built 3,470 fire towers, installed 65,100 miles of telephone lines, scraped and graded thousands of fire breaks, roads, and trails, and built 97,000 miles of truck trails and roads, spent 4.1 million man-hours fighting fires, and cut down and hauled out millions of diseased trees and planted more than 1.3 billion young trees in the first major reforestation campaign in the country’s history. For the National Park Service, they built roads, campgrounds, bridges, and recreation and administration facilities; for the Biological Survey (a predecessor of today’s Fish and Wildlife Service), they conducted wildlife surveys and improved wildlife refuge lands; and for the Army Corps of Engineers, they built flood control projects in West Virginia, Vermont, and New York State. 
<br><br>
<br>In return, the CCC, at its best, took at least some young men out of the urban tangle of hopelessness where so many resided, introduced them to the intricacies and healing joy of the outdoors, and clothed and fed them better than many had been for years. Moreover, the program taught more than a hundred thousand to read and write, passed out twenty-five thousand eighth-grade diplomas and five thousand high-school diplomas, gave structure and discipline to lives that had experienced little of either, and, perhaps more than minds, and for many provided a dose of self-esteem they had never known."
Reggaeton,"<b>HUMANITIES: This passage is adapted from the article “The Ascension of Reggaeton” by Eric Delgado (©2008 by Eric Delgado). </b>
<br>Reggaeton music made its grand entrance onto mainstream U.S. radio with Daddy Yankee’s 2004 crossover hit, “Gasolina.” By that time, reggaeton’s infectious and innovative blend of Jamaican dancehall reggae, Latin American salsa and merengue, and North American hip-hop and electronic music had already been well established and widespread throughout Latin American countries. Reggaeton, pronounced “reggae-TONE,” is thought to have originated in Panama, although the cultivation and popularity of its signature style took place in Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans, inspired by the blend of Spanish rap music and dancehall reggae coming out of Panama in the 1970s and 80s, perfected the genre of reggaeton during the early 1990s. 
<br><br>
<br>Like that of most hybrid musical forms, the evolution of reggaeton can be understood as the effect of underlying ethnic migrations and the resulting cultural overlaps. Such a movement will inevitably create new combinations that are more than the sum of their parts. In the first half of the 20th century, Jamaican laborers migrated to Panama to assist with construction of the Panama Canal. Panamanians became exposed to and enamored with Jamaican reggae, ultimately recording Spanish-language versions of Jamaican reggae songs. In the second half of the 20th century, the modern, more electronic form of Jamaican dancehall reggae was infiltrating Puerto Rico through attentive and interested DJs who imported music from their Caribbean neighbor. 
<br><br>
<br>The reggaeton genre was solidified with the release of a 1991 single by Jamaican dancehall star Shabba Ranks, “Dem Bow.” Recorded in Spanish by Panamanian artist El General as “Son Bow,” the track proved to be such an influential success that the beat of the song, referred to even now as simply “Dem Bow,” is the underlying rhythm of almost every reggaeton song. 
<br><br>
<br>The bass drum accents the downbeat (1st beat) of each measure while a snare accents the syncopated offbeat of the 2nd and onbeat of the 4th beat of each measure. 
<br><br>
<br>Ethan Perry, a musicologist who studies emerging genres, somewhat derisively explains, “Not only is it ironic that one song [“Dem Bow”] can so easily be pinpointed as the catalyst for a new genre, but it is also rare that a musical genre can be so easily defined by such a simple, recurring musical pattern. For this reason, it is hard to take reggaeton seriously as a genre when it seems doomed by its own lack of imagination.” 
<br><br>
<br>Although it may be true that reggaeton has predictable musical features, reggaeton artist Felipe Noche explains that attempts to belittle the genre will only strengthen its core appeal. “Reggaeton is a subversive, underground style. If mainstream critics try to marginalize it, they will only solidify its street credibility, just like someone telling you they don’t like your girlfriend only makes you defend her even more passionately.” Furthermore, reggaeton is not the only musical genre with very stable defining characteristics. Blues music, for example, is characterized by a common type of chord progression known as “12-bar,” and reggae almost universally features guitar or keyboard accents on all the off beats and kick-drum accents on the 3rd beat of each measure. 
<br><br>
<br>The syncopated rhythm found in “Dem Bow” and most reggaeton is fundamental to Latin music. However, the fact that the reggaeton beat is recorded with bold, electronic, dancehall sounds instead of acoustic percussive instruments sets this style of music apart from the music Latino youths associate with their parents. When added to the aggressive, dance-friendly, urban rap lyrics that typify reggaeton songs, it is not difficult to see how the genre offers Latino youth a provocative mixture of something culturally familiar but brashly individualistic. 
<br><br>
<br>The dissemination of reggaeton throughout the U.S. during the late 1990s was predictably strongest in areas with vibrant Puerto Rican communities, such as New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. The work of influential Puerto Rican DJ Playero in the 90s helped to introduce these communities to eventual reggaeton stars like Daddy Yankee, Don Chezina, Master Joe, and O.G. Black. The popularity of reggaeton has extended internationally, finding audiences throughout the Caribbean, as well as in Europe and Asia. These latter successes suggest the undeniable appeal of the genre is not limited to the Latino youth who first embraced it. 
<br><br>
<br> “At first when I got requests to play shows in Japan, I was truly stunned,” says reggaeton artist Dos Cabezas, “but I think there’s an energy to this music that makes it exciting to everyone. It’s got a gritty sound that evokes the rough attitude of street cultures everywhere, and the beat just makes people want to move.” 
<br><br>
<br>Despite the negative feedback from some music critics who find the music too repetitive and from some parents who find the lyrics too violent and sexually suggestive, reggaeton at least deserves the recognition of being a distinct art form that has achieved global prevalence in the early part of this century. "
Star,"<b>NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article “Not Dead Yet: A Dying Star Is Caught Flaring Briefly Back to Life” by Charles Liu (©2005 by Natural History Magazine, Inc.). </b>
<br>About a billion years before a sunlike star “dies,” or stops generating energy via nuclear fusion, it becomes a red giant, growing dramatically to a hundred times its original diameter. Then, as the red-giant phase ends, the star blows off its outer layers, giving rise to an expanding gas cloud called a planetary nebula. The planetary nebula, in turn, swells in size and drops in density for at most another 100,000 years, exposing the remaining stellar core at its center. That core becomes a white dwarf — the most common celestial cadaver visible in the sky. The white dwarf usually radiates its leftover heat into space for billions of years, and it slowly fades to black. 
<br><br>
<br>Some soon-to-be white dwarfs, however, seem to heed the counsel of poet Dylan Thomas: “Do not go gentle into that good night.” According to the theory of stellar evolution, the temperature in the stellar core can fluctuate wildly, and sometimes spikes as high as tens of millions of degrees. For a little while at least, the core may even flicker back into stellar life as a giant star; generating new energy with new flares of nuclear fusion.
<br><br>
<br>Alas, such a giant can't last long, because the core is, in essence, running on fumes. Without a substantial fuel source to sustain fusion, a nuclear re-ignition of this kind runs out of gas within a few centuries, and the star heads back toward white dwarfhood. But during its brief return to fusion-powered life, its interaction with the surrounding cloud of gas creates a fascinating astronomical laboratory for the study of stellar and interstellar processes. 
<br><br>
<br>The star FG Sagittae, a highly variable star in the constellation Sagitta, seems to be a case in point. FG Sagittae lies at the heart of a planetary nebula called He 1-5. In the past thirty years the star's temperature has dropped from more than 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit to less than 10,000 degrees, though its brightness has changed erratically from year to year. As with an old, grease-choked diesel engine struggling to start back up, the star's efforts to restart nuclear fusion create puffs of thick smoke — carbon atoms coughed up from the fading stellar core. The smoke absorbs the star's radiating heat and periodically obscures the visible light it emits. To see through the haze and examine the goings-on near the star's surface, astronomers must look at its radiation in less obscured wavelengths, such as infrared light. 
<br><br>
<br>A research team led by Robert A. Gehrz of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis has now done just that. Recently the team published the results of twenty years of monitoring the infrared properties of FG Sagittae with three telescopes equipped with infrared photometers — in effect, photon counters. One instrument is in Minnesota, one in Arizona, and one in Wyoming. Gehrz and his colleagues discovered that, though the star’s overall brightness and temperature have changed dramatically through the years, carbon dust from the surface of FG Sagittae has been shining more or less steadily at a temperature of about 1,200 degrees F (650 degrees Celsius). That's roughly hot enough to melt aluminum, but substantially cooler than the core of any star undergoing active nuclear fusion. Gehrz and his colleagues conclude that, besides giving rise to clouds of obscuring gas, FG Sagittae is powering a strong stellar wind peppered with this carbon dust. They think this dust has been glowing continuously for the past decade. On the basis of the measured amount of emitted infrared radiation, Gehrz's team estimates that the wind is carrying between 1.5 and 7.5 quadrillion (1.5 to 7.5 x 10^15) tons of stellar material away from FG Sagittae each second — or about eight to forty Earth masses each year. 
<br><br>
<br>Sooner rather than later the current burst of new nuclear fusion will cease, and the dusty stellar wind will cease. The stellar core, no longer obscured by a thick, dusty blanket, will turn once more into a hot white dwarf. If, as theoretical models predict, the stellar renaissance of FG Sagittae lasts a few hundred years, the wind will deposit thousands of Earth-masses' worth of carbon-rich matter into the star's surroundings. The carbon atoms, as they cool down, could become seeds for the buildup of interstellar dust grains — which, in turn, could seed the formation of asteroids, moons, planets, and perhaps eventually even life as we know it. Maybe the astronomers of the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth century will look toward FG Sagittae and see, in its surroundings, the potential makings of a new and distant earth. "
Charities,"<b>Social Science: This passage is adapted from the article “When Charities Need Help” by Ellen Wurtner (©2009 by Ellen Wurtner). </b>
<br><br>
<br>Traditionally, when people think of charitable giving, there are only a few images that spring to mind. They probably envision dropping change into the Salvation Army basket outside retail stores around the holidays, or into a basket passed around at their places of worship, or even into the hands of a homeless person whose pitiable appearance and humble request for “anything you can spare” is hard to deny. But can’t we do better?
<br><br>
<br>Religious institutions have typically been the societal force that drives philanthropy. This is most likely because religion is vitally intertwined with morality, and charitable generosity has forever been exalted as one of the highest forms of moral behavior. Typically, churches collect alms for the poor at their church services and organize such hunger relief activities as soup kitchens.
<br><br>
<br>Ted Stumbacher, head of the Global Empowerment Initiative, believes that truly effective philanthropy will need to have at its roots a more economic mindset. He feels religious organizations often provide only a temporary reprieve from suffering related to food, clothing, or shelter. While a noble end, this type of charity succeeds more in establishing a life-long commitment to philanthropy among the churchgoing public than it does in remedying any of the systemic problems that face the world’s impoverished masses.
<br><br>
<br>Stumbacher points to several transformations taking place over the past two decades as harbingers of the new paradigm of philanthropic organizations. Some organizations are devoting increased attention to their marketing images, using meticulous branding and celebrity endorsements to solidify consumer awareness. Despite the fact that charities are nonprofit entities, they can still approach the task of maximizing their “market share” the way that other big corporations do. More commonly, nonprofits are finding non-monetary forms of assistance to tap, such as stationing clothing-recycling drop boxes around dense cities. These drop boxes not only allow used clothing to be funneled to those in need but also prevent needless environmental waste by keeping these textiles out of the world’s trash.
<br><br>
<br>Similarly, Stumbacher notes the new giving strategies that look to increase the consumer choice aspect of giving. Rather than dumping money into the traditional model of citizens simply dropping coins into a basket intended for some generic form of relief to the poor, organizations like Donors Choose are giving philanthropists much more decision-making power in how their money is used. The website for Donors Choose allows donors to sift through a list of charitable projects, enabling them to fund the cause they find most worthy. This model has proven to motivate giving by providing the giver with concrete imagery of where his money is going.
<br><br>
<br>Other philanthropists, such as Karen Pitts, founder of Taste of Giving, say they are “seeking to engage donors by merging their charitable giving with other activities they enjoy.” Ms. Pitts has organized wine tastings that successfully raise tens of thousands of dollars for charities. This is essentially a win-win-win situation. The wineries receive the excellent promotional context of a charitable event, the affluent wine drinkers are delighted to help others while enjoying themselves, and the charities enjoy a healthy slice of the financial proceeds.
Perhaps the most forward-minded approach is that of Jacqueline Novogratz, founder of the Acumen Fund. Endeavoring to extinguish poverty at its roots, the Acumen Fund collects donations in a typical way but then treats its pool of resources as investment capital. Instead of providing immediate relief of suffering, the Acumen Fund provides micro-loans to small businesses throughout third-world countries. Novogratz believes that this capitalistic approach is a more tenable form of long-term aid.
<br><br>
<br>The old Chinese proverb, “give a man a fish and you’ll feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you’ll feed him for a lifetime” seems to be at the root of Novogratz’s philosophy. By providing poor people with investment capital rather than food or clothing, she hopes to nourish and sustain them economically so that they can provide for themselves. Moreover, the Acumen Fund is a very hands-on enterprise, making regular inspections of the businesses they fund to verify that money is being spent shrewdly, efficiently, and honestly.
<br><br>
<br>Unfortunately, what makes so many of these innovative philanthropic approaches inspiring and effective is their adaptation to the specific needs of their locales. Naysayers are quick to point out that these progressive business models may not be tenable on a large scale. As these ambitious charities grow in size, they may become lumbering giants similar to traditional aid organizations, such as UNICEF and the Rockefeller Foundation, and lose the flexibility, creativity, and personality that made them great.
<br><br>
<br>However, even if these new tactics cannot be used in all contexts, they are still very valuable. By redefining what forms charity can take, these new approaches are widening the base of donors. By employing innovative methods, these philanthropic entrepreneurs are helping larger charitable organizations to reexamine and refine their own approach."
