14582817,Charities,Q1,"In the article, ""When Charities Need help"", Ellen Wurtner discusses how charitable has different reasonings behind donating and how philanthropists can inspire to increase charity with different approaches. There are many ways to give back in charity, such in religious institutions that are seen to be more of moral reasons driving this behavior. While they may help more to temporary needs, other might argue how charities can build more commitment to help other problem happening around world.

14582817,Depression,Q1,"In 1933, President Roosevelt, had motives to develop federal public lands and use unemployed men to be able to work in project. The president made an agency called the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and was able to enlist men 17 to 27 to help with the projects. The men who volunteered, were paid monthly, provided food, and housing. Moreover, men could only serve nine months to allows others to have an opportunity to join as well. This program made great progress in being able to work on natural forests, telephone lines, trees, roads, and more. Not only did this benefit the country, but also the men working as they were able to work, obtain diplomas, and learn more."

14582817,Star,Q1,"Planetary nebulas are an expanded form of gas cloud that later on go down in size. When more smaller, the show the core in middle which turn into a white dwarf and last billions of years in space. Before they become white dwarfs, they have a lot heat in them which correlates with a theory of stellar evolutions. It is believed before turning into a white dwarf, the heat can make a big star  create nuclear fusion. This has been seen with FG Sagittate, the heat changes during the years seen going through nuclear fusion despite temperature being low."

14582817,Migration,Q1,"Many birds migrate throughout the year to adapt to seasonal changes and find a area that can accommodate this. There are many reasons around how birds can choose when to fly such as biology, nutrition, and social pressure.It is important for birds to have fuel and food availability before and after they migrate. With this birds,  must prepare before migration, but scientists found some birds, who didn't seem fit, still flew. This showed that social pressure overrides more with being healthy. As some birds start to mirgrate, other will follow too, even though they might be fueled good."

14602058,Star,Q1,"This passage is talking about how a dying star is flaring back to life. The star is FG Sagittae in the constellation where is resides at the heart of a planetary nebula known as He 1-5. For the last 30 years the star temperature has dropped, and its brightness has changed from year to year. In order, to restart the nuclear fusion of the star, astronomer need to examine the star's surface and radiation through infrared light. A research team by Robert A from the University of Minnesota has been monitoring the infrared items with three infrared photometers telescopes in Minnesota, Arizona, and Wyoming. Where they concluded that the FG Sagittae star has a strong wing peppered with carbon dust, that has been glowing. The FG Sagittae can wind thousands of Earth mass worth of carbon rich matter that can form basically life, or of a new and distant Earth."

The star is FG Sagittae in the constellation where is resides at the heart of a planetary nebula known as He 1-5. For the last 30 years the star temperature has dropped, and its brightness has changed from year to year. In order, to restart the nuclear fusion of the star, astronomer need to examine the star's surface and radiation through infrared light. A research team by Robert A from the University of Minnesota has been monitoring the infrared items with three infrared photometers telescopes in Minnesota, Arizona, and Wyoming. Where they concluded that the FG Sagittae star has a strong wing peppered with carbon dust, that has been glowing. The FG Sagittae can wind thousands of Earth mass worth of carbon rich matter that can form basically life, or of a new and distant Earth."

14602058,Charities,Q1,"This passage is essentially talking about the different way charities can be provided to help those in need. It starts off discussing the stereotypes of charitable giving and how often many don't because of the limited options to do so. In many locations the most common form of charities is by donating money, this option for many is not ideal because it's not guaranteed it's used for not. So, the passage goes in detail about other forms of charitable opportunities such as a website called Donors Choose and charitable event like wine tasting, all of these are great options but due to ambitious business they do not want to adapt to specific needs for the community."

14590121,Migration,Q1,"Bird migration is driven by weather, food, and survival needs. Changing seasons push birds to travel long distances, and scientists study how instinct and memory guide the journey. Migration also depends on food supply and daylight changes.

14710757,Star,Q1,"It is about a sunlike star that sort of ""dies"" in a way. It is usually when this star stops generating energy. It gives us the process it goes through to get to the center and what exactly happens through that time and how long each thing can take. The core of what is left over is usually called the white dwarf. Sometimes the core can even flicker back into a stellar life as a giant star. It is something that wont last as long as they usually will. 
The star FG Sagittae Is at the heart of the planetary nebula called He 1-5. This star temperture has dropped through the past 30 years. because of the temperture drop they will lose nuclear fusion. When this happens there is usually a thick smoke , which absorbs the star's radiation and that is because this will make it easy for to e seen."

The War Department was the ones to give them housing and food for their nonworking hours and the Department of Agriculture and Interior were the one to design an supervise them during their projects. They would get a monthly payment of $30 or $23 to $25 of it be sent tot heir families. The estimated cost for the first year was $500 million. They were very strict on who they were accepting to work with them and they had to have specific details on how they looked within hight and weight. Some of the early enrollees were veterans who had returned to Washington, they were demanding payment of their bonuses . They were not granted on it, but they were still accepted to stay in those grounds to do what they had to do. The only way that they would be accepted by it is if they also worked with the CCC and they would get their age restiction wieved and things like that.

By producing carbon dust that blocks its light, FG sagittae is making a rare appearance, requiring astronomers to use more sophisticated equipment. Carbon dust emissions could lead to the emergence of new planets. It would be a waste of material for future worlds if it turned into a white dwarf."

14602659,Reggaeton,Q1,"Although reggaeton was already well liked un Latin America, it didn't become popular in the United Sates until 2004. It originated in Panama and gained popularity in Puerto Rico. This is basically a blend of Hip hop, Latin music, and Jamaican reggae. The ""Dem Bow"" rhythm eventually evolved into the fundamental beats of reggaeton. Artists claims that this is the pint to strengthen the genre's individuality, while some claim it is overly repetitious. Latino kids find the genre appealing because it feels independent, bold, contemporary, and familiar to their culture."

14602659,Migration,Q1,"Birds migrate to breeding grounds and wintering destinations. Due to its unpredictability, migratory timing is not solely determined by the weather. Instead, birds have a built in clock. A bird's food source is crucial to their ability to procreate. A 1967 study on chaffinches revealed that larger, healthier birds migrate first in pleasant weather, while smaller birds migrate in bad weather because of social pressure. However, other birds, such as wandering albatrosses, rely on their unique wings for currents and low-energy movements while migrating over great distances."

That core becomes a white dwarf, the most common celestial cadaver visible in the sky. It radiates its leftover heat into space for billions of years, and slowly fades to black."

14682860,Migration,Q1,"Bird species make seasonal trips between cooler breeding grounds in the spring and summer, and warmer locations in autumn and winter. Migration is a part of the annual cycle of over 50 billion individual birds worldwide. Not all birds migrate. There are many species, particularly in the tropics, that remain in a single residence throughout the year. But the biological mechanisms that prompt birds to choose a particular date to begin migration are more complex and appear to be influenced by many factors. 

The most obvious factor is the weather. However, seasonal weather patterns are known to be unpredictable. Therefore, it is clear that birds must rely more on an internal clock to time their seasonal movements."

14592341,Star,Q1,"This article describes the cycle of a sunlike star before it essentially ""dies"". The very last phase is when the core becomes a white dwarf, and it ends up radiating its' leftover heat into space for billions years and will eventually fade to black. But for some white dwarfs they don't follow that same routine of slowly fading away, instead the core can fluctuate in temperature like crazy, and temporarily flick into a giant star. Though these white dwarfs aren't very long lived, because the core doesn't have enough fuel. They use the star FG Sagittae as a perfect example, this star has fluctuated in temperature dramatically in the past thirty years, and as it tries to restart nuclear fusion it releases a think carbon atom filled puff of smoke. Researchers have now found that the same puff of carbon atoms can potentially be means for life."

14592341,Depression,Q10,"This article talks about how present FDR changed the lives of many with his new proposal for a program young men and veterans. This program called the Civilian Conservation Corps, the program was originally imagined to be a volunteer ""army""  when young men could enlist and be put to work, specifically in national forest, national parks and other federal public lands. The men were paid monthly but majority of their income went to their families, this was because the men had a place to live eat and shower.

14645467,Migration,Q1,"Most migratory birds move mainly because food supplies change with the seasons, and they need plenty of nutrition and stored fat both to reproduce and to fuel long flights.

The passage also explains that some species, like wandering albatrosses, migrate vast distances with relatively low energy cost by using specialized wings and wind patterns, spending much of their lives in the air traveling between distant habitats."

Finally, it emphasizes that the CCC not only transformed the American landscape but also changed the lives of its enrollees by taking them out of urban poverty, giving them food, shelter, education, discipline, and self‑esteem, and even drawing in World War I veterans who accepted Roosevelt’s offer of steady work and joined the camps."

14701195,Reggaeton,Q1,"-Reggaeton music made its entrance into mainstream U.S. radio with Daddy Yankee's hit 'Gasolina' in 2004. By that time, reggaeton had been well established and widespread throughout Latin American countries. It has been thought that it originated in Panama,  although the popularity of its signature style took place in Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans perfected the genre of reggaeton during the early '90s. The evolution of reggaeton can be understood as the effect of ethnic migrations & cultural overlaps. In the first half of the 20th century, Jamaican laborers migrated to Panama to assist with the construction of the Panama Canal. Panamanians became exposed to the Jamaican reggae. In the second half of the 20th century, the Jamaican reggae was infiltrating Puerto Rico. The reggaeton was solidified with the release of ""Dem Bow"" by Shabba Ranks.

14719893,Depression,Q1,"To summarize, FDR created a program that would allow young man that had no job to work in national parks where food, clothes and shelter would be provided for them. The program first acronym was CCRYRM and later shortened to CCC. The program would pay $30 a month, and $23- $25 would be sent to families. The program first started on April 5, 1933, with 250,000 housed in 1,468 camps around the country. By the time the program was cut the young man had built; 3,470 fire towers, 650,100 miles of telephone lines, hauled diseased trees, planted 1.3 billion new ones, and made roads, campgrounds, bridges, recreation and administrative facilities. This program also greatly benefited the man as they were not only fed, clothed and house but many learned how to read and write, got both 8th grade and high school diplomas as well as a boost of self-esteem."

14719893,Migration,Q1,"To summarize birds' migration is complex and scientists are trying to figure out why these birds migrate at different times of the year. One conclusion they came to is the weather as many birds typically migrate to warmer climate due to the shifting seasons, yet they aren't so sure as the climate in unpredictable and with also seeing captured birds having a phenomenon called ""migratory restlessness"" it can be assumed that most birds have an interval clock that tells them when to migrate. Another possible explanation they came up with is the food supply being a big factor as Russian ornithologist Viktor Dolnik and Tatiana Blyumental watched birds migrate in different waves, they noted that the ones that had more fat were the ones that migrated first as well as they did not eat and relied on the fat stored. They still watched the waves as more and more of the leaner birds started to migrate; some which were still eating and others that eat before leaving even when the weather would have made it hard for them to migrate. Although these findings don't take into account other birds (sea birds, raptors, or natural species) or how long their migration last, they help paint a few factors as to way some birds may migrate."

14719893,Star,Q1,"To summarize the articles, talk about how when a sun-like start dies a white dwarf is left behind that slowly burns out until it's gone. However, some researchers have noticed that these white dwarfs have sometimes started to show light again like they used to but often times it doesn't last. An example of one of these white dwarfs is the star, FG Sagittae. This ""dead"" star has been shown to sometimes flare up like it's coming back to live before dying out again. A professor leads a research team to look into this star which includes having three telescopes: one in Arizona, one in Minnesota and another in Wyoming. The information gathered shows that although FG has flared up the core is still way to cool for it to start nuclear fusion again."

14742130,Star,Q1,"A ""sunlike star"" will grow largely in size and appear a red color billions of years before dying. Subjected to different phases, it will result in a planetary nebula which is a cloud of gas. Following the same process, this nebula will grow have a lower density for thousands of ears. What is left is the core, also known as the white dwarf. This dwarf will go from radiating heat to slowly fading away. 
There is a star called the FG Sagittae that has made efforts to revive in a way. It will continue to shine somewhat steadily and a temperature that is rather low for a few more hundred years. Ultimately it will revert to being a white dwarf again after its carbon dust ""blanket"" has dispersed. In the end what will be left range from asteroids, moons, etc."

Officially recognized as its own genre with Panamanian El General's Spanish song ""Son Bow"" which was a cover of ""Dem Bow"" by Jamaican Shabba Banks. 
Reggaeton is an underground style that is a bold blend of different musics. Although easily recognizable, that does not diminish its appeal. 
Spread throughout the US mainly through Puerto Rican communicates in New York and Los Angeles. The 90s gave rise to stars like Daddy Yankee, Don Chezina and more.

14742130,Migration,Q1,"Many species of birds, particularly tropical birds, migrate between to cooler locations in the spring and summer and warmer location in the autumn and winter. But it's not that simple. This journey is influenced by many factors and the birds and intentional with their timing. Weather is one of the main tale tells, although unpredictable. Due to this the birds rely on an internal clock to decide when to migrate. There is something called the ""migratory restlessness"" that impacts caged birds since they are able to migrate. 
Furthermore, food also serves as a factor. Seasonal changed directly impact the abundance of food like berries, insects, etc. So birds must not only worry about when food will run out but they have to leave before it becomes scare to bulk up. This is to use their body fat as fuel during their journey to different locations. Dolnik and Blyumental, Russian ornithologists studied migrating Chaffinches on their journey along the Baltic Coast. They found that only fate birds flew on the first day of each wave of migration by studying their fat content and amount of food they had in the carcasses. Relying on their stored fat, the birds left at the best time suited for an easy flight. 
During the soon wave, once again only the fat birds flew. As time passed the lean birds also joined in, using their stored energy from that mornings breakfast. It was noted that this study can not be used for all birds since only Chaffinches were studied. Not representing sea birds, raptors, nocturnal species, etc. Furthermore many birds travel much further than the Chaffinches, travels up to hundreds of kilometers.

During the soon wave, once again only the fat birds flew. As time passed the lean birds also joined in, using their stored energy from that mornings breakfast. It was noted that this study can not be used for all birds since only Chaffinches were studied.

14742130,Migration,Q6,"Many species of birds, particularly tropical birds, migrate between to cooler locations in the spring and summer and warmer location in the autumn and winter. But it's not that simple. This journey is influenced by many factors and the birds and intentional with their timing. Weather is one of the main tale tells, although unpredictable. Due to this the birds rely on an internal clock to decide when to migrate. There is something called the ""migratory restlessness"" that impacts caged birds since they are able to migrate. 
Furthermore, food also serves as a factor. Seasonal changed directly impact the abundance of food like berries, insects, etc. So birds must not only worry about when food will run out but they have to leave before it becomes scare to bulk up. This is to use their body fat as fuel during their journey to different locations. Dolnik and Blyumental, Russian ornithologists studied migrating Chaffinches on their journey along the Baltic Coast.

14742130,Charities,Q1,"Charitable giving goes beyond just dropping change into the Salvation Army basket or into the hands of the homeless. According to Ted Stumbacher, to really provide a more permanent relief to the unfortunate, it must start with an economic mindset.

From increasing attention to their marketing images to spread their consumer awareness, to having clothing-recycling drop boxes around cities, these are more beneficial in the end.
This is also said to improve the customers opinion on giving back. They are able to make decisions in how and where their money is used depending one what charitable projects they choose. Furthermore, Acumen Fund found Novogratz also finds that the start to ending poverty must be tacked with an economic mindset. This is the best way to a more tenable form of permanent aid.

The CCC would officially begin on April 5, 1933, costing $500 million in the first year. The CCC was able to put more than 3 million people to work and built roads, bridges, etc. while also fighting fires and planting new trees. The program was a major success and stands as a testament of the greater fight to protect nature's most beautiful creations."

14281341,Migration,Q1,"Over 50 billion individual birds migrate every year as part of the annual cycle. A major factor in the timing of seasonal bird migration is the weather. When it cools and precipitates, birds will migrate to the direction of warmer weather. Even so, seasonal weather patterns are often unpredictable, meaning that birds must rely more on an internal clock to time their movements. Even for caged birds, they will become ""restless"" at the same time as migratory birds. Another factor in migratory patterns is food supply, which birds need to reproduce and survive during their migration."

14312853,Charities,Q1,"When poeple think about charitable giving they often imagine donations to places like houses of worship, the salvation Army, or Handing money to a homeless person. The author explains that philanthropy is deeply connected to religion, morality, and generosity, often seen as a way to honor God. Religious organizations and their churches have historically helped the poor through soup kitchens and hunger relief efforts.

Religious organizations and their churches have historically helped the poor through soup kitchens and hunger relief efforts. 

Ted Stumbacher of the Global Empowerment Initiative argues that effective philanthropy should move beyond just an economic mindset. He believes religious organizations provide temp aid but don't address the bigger picture that would truly help people in need. According to him, their help mainly benefits hose who want to be generous rather than those who most need assistance. Over the past 20 years, new forms of philanthropy have emerged, focusing more on celebrating and branding the helpers instead of just the help itself.

14312853,Migration,Q1,"Many bird species travel seasonally moving between cooler breeding surroundings in the spring and summer and warmer regions in the fall and winter. Migration involves over 50 billion birds worldwide, though not all species migrate, esp those in tropical areas that remain in one place year 'round. 
The timing of migration is influenced by variety of factors, but as climate change manifests it becomes unreliable indicators wince weather patterns shift unpredictably. Birds also cannot always rely on visual cues like the sun/stars due to cloud cover. 
Scientists believe that birds rely on internal biological clocks to know when to migrate. The idea is supported by the observation of ""migratory restlessness,"" a behavior shown by caged birds at the same time that wild birds of their species begin their seasonal journeys."

The stars hot core, now exposed, beomes a white dwarf, which gradually cools and dims over billions of year, but some stars ""flare back to life.""
During this late stage, unstable temperatures in the star's core can rise dramatically, reaching high millions of degrees. These sudden bursts may briefly restart nuclear fusion, causing the fading star to shine like a diamond one last time before it ultimately cools into darkness."

14320516,Star,Q1,"This passage discusses about what happens after sunlike star ""dies"" as the star FD Sagittae had reignited nuclear fusion for a brief moment after becoming a white dwarf. It was found that the star runs on fumes that would eventually run out though when the star would briefly ignite, carbon atoms would be coughed up from the core, forming clouds and the smoke absorbs the star's heat, though it loses vast amount of material each year. When fusion stops again and the carbon atoms cool down, they can create the formation of rocks asteroids, planets and other form of life."

14354498,Migration,Q1,"Birds have different migration cycles throughout the seasons. Weather is a big hindrance to bird migration. Food is important for storing energy to fuel migration. Fat birds were able to fly at favorable weather conditions due to stored fat, and the leaner the bird was the later they'd migrate.

14296419,Star,Q1,"About a billion years before a sunlike star dies, it expands into a red giant. It's outer layers become planetary nebulae and it turns into a white dwarf, cooling for billions of years before becoming a black dwarf. Some stars reignite before the end of their life cycle. 
FG Sagittae in the constellation Sagitta appears to be one such case. It has cooled by a large degree over the recent decades while changing in brightness. During its fusion restart, it ejects carbon ""smoke"" that obscures its light.
Astronomers led by Robert A. Gehrz monitored FG Sagittae's infrared emissions for twenty years, finding its carbon dust glows steadily at about 1,200°F. They estimate the star loses anywhere from 1.5–7.5 quadrillion tons of material per second through intense stellar winds.
Once this brief fusion episode ends, the dust and wind will cease, and FG Sagittae will resume its path to becoming a white dwarf. The expelled carbon may eventually contribute to interstellar dust."

14296419,Migration,Q1,"Many bird species migrate seasonally between breeding and wintering grounds, guided by both environmental and biological factors. In addition to weather and food availability, birds use internal clocks to time migration, as shown by “migratory restlessness” in captive birds.
Food supply strongly influences migration: birds must leave while food is still abundant enough to build fat reserves for long flights. Some even seem to anticipate environmental changes, suggesting internal triggers.
In 1967, Russian scientists Viktor Dolnik and Tatiana Blyumental found that in chaffinches, fat birds migrate first under good conditions, while leaner ones follow later—sometimes in poor weather—likely due to social pressure from earlier departures.
Migration patterns differ widely: most species travel moderate distances, but others, like the wandering albatross, spend much of their lives in flight, covering vast distances efficiently by riding air currents."

14296419,Reggaeton,Q10,"Reggaeton, a hybrid genre blending Jamaican dancehall reggae, Latin salsa and merengue, and North American hip-hop, gained mainstream U.S. attention with Daddy Yankee's 2004 hit ""Gasolina."" Though rooted in Panama, Puerto Ricans refined the genre in the early 1990s, influenced by Spanish-language rap versions of Jamaican reggae and dancehall. The 1991 track ""Dem Bow"" by Shabba Ranks (adapted by Panamanian artist El General) established reggaeton's signature beat, which remains central to the genre.
Reggaeton spread initially in U.S. cities with strong Puerto Rican communities, aided by DJs like Playero, and has since gained international popularity with its energetic, street-inspired rhythms appealing to diverse audiences. Critics sometimes dismiss it as repetitive or violent, but artists and scholars defend its artistic significance and underground credibility. Its electronic, syncopated beats differentiate it from traditional Latin music."

14304172,Star,Q1,"Usually, when a star roughly the size of the sun gets old, it'll turn into a red gaint, before releasing its layers into a nebula that eventually reveals the core, now a white dwarf, which then lasts for billions of years. But some white dwarfs may instead be capable of reforming into a giant star, although for a brief amount of time, cosmically speaking, as it does not have enough resources to sustain itself, turning back into a white dwarf. FG Sagittae is an example of a similar case, as it seems to attempt to restart its fusion, but ultimately releasing black smoke that obscures its light. Gehrz and his team have been monitoring FG Sagittae and has recorded the temperature of Sagittae's surface, which is not hot enough to  properly maintain active nuclear fusion. Cosmic dust that the core produces also powers a stellar wind, and provides a glow that has lasted for the past decade, and the core has been losing mass from these winds and loss of dust over the years. It is possible that even after the core stops producing these, and turns back into a dwarf, the dust could possibly be the start of new stellar structures, but that is for future society to find out."

Gehrz and his team have been monitoring FG Sagittae and has recorded the temperature of Sagittae's surface, which is not hot enough to  properly maintain active nuclear fusion. Cosmic dust that the core produces also powers a stellar wind, and provides a glow that has lasted for the past decade, and the core has been losing mass from these winds and loss of dust over the years. It is possible that even after the core stops producing these, and turns back into a dwarf, the dust could possibly be the start of new stellar structures, but that is for future society to find out."

14304172,Migration,Q1,"Migration is a common behavior for more than 50 billion birds worldwide, occuring annually, and we do not have a full understanding of why they do so. Weather is a strong factor, as the birds move towards warmer weather. However, weather is an unreliable measure, so it is thought that birds have an internal ability to know when to migrate, which can be seen in caged birds through ""migratory restlessness"". Food is both important towards the bird's capability of migration (having to build up body fat for energy), and a reason for the bird to migrate, in order to reach a new food supply. Ornithologists discovered that fatter chaffinces start their migration first, with leaner ones following later. There is an influence where the healthier chaffinces migrating causes the more unready chaffinces to be pressured into migrating too. The length of migration also varies, with some species taking only days or weeks, while others take months. Some birds even spend less energy in the air than sitting still, including albatrosses who spent almost their entire life in the air, with immense migrations, using the air currents to support their travelling."

14324372,Reggaeton,Q1,"The music genre known as ""Reggaeton"" was said to have originally released in Panama in the 1970s and 80s, though it wasn't until the early 1990s that the genre got perfected.

Essentially, Panamanians become exposed to the Jamaican reggae, thus leading to  the 20th century move of the modernized, more electronic form of Jamaican dancehill regga that infiltrated Puerto Rico.

14324372,Migration,Q1,"Migration is an event most commonly observed through difference species such as butterflies, birds, ducks, etc... Though this passage primarily focuses on the migration of birds and takes the natural world into account, suggesting seasonal influences (color breeding = spring and summer, warmer locations = autumn and winter). Off of birds alone, they make up for over 50 billion of species that have migration as a part of their annual cycle. Additionally, this doesn't include all birds as there particular birds who remain in a single location all year round (tropical locations). Birds determine when to migrate through a variety of complex factors, the most basic idea being the cycle of the weather (seasons, colder weathers leading to birds migrating to warmer locations). Though this isn't always the case as obstructions in the clouds could impair the ability to predict the right time to migrate, hence birds must rely on an interal clock to time the seasonal movments (migratory restlessness)."

14324861,Charities,Q1,"Traditionally, people think of charity as giving money to someone in need, like dropping change in a salvation army bucket, giving at church, or helping a homeless person. Most charity has come from religious groups because helping others is seen as a very moral thing to do. Churches often organize collections or soup kitchens to help the poor. But some people, like Ted Stumbacher, think charity could be more effective if it focused on long-term solutions, not just temporary help with food or shelter. Over the past 20 years charities have started to change how they work by finding creative ways to help, like clothing drop boxes that give clothes to people in need and such."

In 1993, he created a program to put unemployed young men to work in national forests, parks, and other public lands. He first called it the Civilian Corps Reforestation Youth Rehabilitation Movement, but it was quickly shortened to the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC. Congress approved it but let Roosevelt run it his way for 2 years. The Labor Department chose the workers, the War Department housed and fed them, and the Agriculture and Interior Department supervised the projects.

14324861,Star,Q1,"About a billion years before a sunlike star dies, it becomes a red giant and grows huge, about a hundred times bigger than before. After this phase, the star blows off its outer layers, creating a gas cloud called a planetary nebula. The nebula expands and becomes less dense, leaving the star's core exposed. This core turns into a white dwarf, which slowly gives off its leftover heat for billions of years before fading to black. Some white dwarfs, though, don't go quietly. Their cores can suddenly heat up again to millions of degrees, causing debrief bursts of new energy and nuclear fusion, almost like the star comes back to life for a short time."

14324861,Migration,Q1,"Many birds migrate every year, moving to cooler areas in the spring and summer to breed and to warmer areas in autumn and winter. Not all birds migrate though, some, especially in the tropics, stay in one place year-round. Figuring out when to start migration is complicated and depends on many factors, Weather is a big influence, since cooler temperatures and more rain push birds toward warmer areas. But weather isn't always predictable, and things like clouds can hide the sun or stars that birds use for navigation. Because of this, birds also rely on an internal clock. Scientists have even noticed migratory restlessness in birds kept in cages at the same time wild birds start their migrations"

14347006,Star,Q1,"A star generates energy through nuclear fusion. Around a billion years before it dies, the star becomes an inflated red giant, before exploding into a planetary nebula, which will eventually become less dense to reveal the white dwarf within, a weaker, less impressive reminder of what the star once was. White dwarves can, however, undergo periodic flares of nuclear fusion, becoming short-lived, temporary giant stars that in their process of energy generation jut out ""dust clouds"" of carbon atoms. Such is the case with FG Sagittae, examined by astronomers through infrared light tracking, where they discovered it having a temperature being around 650˚C and generating winds that carry substantial masses of stellar material away from FG Saggitae per year.

14347006,Depression,Q1,"The New Deal established the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), partly out of Franklin Roosevelt's love for trees himself. Lasting two years, the work was almost entirely divided within the executive branch of government through executive orders. The CCC official began on April 5, 1933. Its earliest enrollees were veterans who'd set up camp demanding bonuses for their services in the war. Roosevelt, unrelenting, provided them with shelter and necessities, and his wife to soothe the camp, which eventually convinced about 2500 of those men to join the CCC. The CCC ended in 1942, resulting in new fire towers, telephone lines, improved transportation infrastructure, rejuvenated forests, amongst other great contributions. Beyond that, it also granted literacy and hope to over a hundred thousand Americans."

14392280,Migration,Q1,"It is very common for birds to make seasonal trips. Birds tend to migrate only when their food reserves are high but due to the unpredictability of the seasonal weather, birds relay on an internal clock to time their seasonal movements and to help accommodate variations in weather and food supply. A researcher, Viktor Dolnik, 1967, found that ""fat"" chaffinches birds were always they first to begin the migration period early in the morning as they had more energy to begin the trip. As the day progressed, ""leaner"" birds would begin their migration although their energy reverse weren't full, haven't ate enough or weren't ""fat"" enough. This was thought to occur due to pressure of being left behind. These patterns are not true for every species of birds as some can travel greater distances using little energy and vice-versa."
